    If you want to have a dynamic website that you can edit, you'll need a
    content management system (CMS). This gives you complete control over the
    content. The design is always free...you only have to pay for CMS hosting.

    All you have to pay for is the hosting or custom domain name, which is
    handled by third-party firms, which is ideal for smaller websites like
    webnp. We'll set everything up for you and keep an eye on your site in the
    future. Web hosting is available for as little as a few ringgits per month.

    We believe that all charities, non-profits, and nonprofits should have
    attractive and functional websites to benefit the people and communities
    they serve, as well as to raise funds and spread their message. The only
    issue is that websites may be quite costly! We're dedicated to building
    websites for free! We've already built websites for small businesses and
    have a couple more projects in the works!
